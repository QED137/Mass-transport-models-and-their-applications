# Mass Transport Phenomenon Modeling
## Introduction

The project focuses on the comprehensive study of mass transport phenomena,. However , mass transport phenoma has been modleled usng diffusion equation . this project takes different approach to model mass transport phenomena.   At the microscopic level, these phenomena involve intricate processes such as fragmentation, adsorption, diffusion, and aggregation, which are widespread in nature . The rate eqaution for such growth model would be like this 
## Rate Equations

Let $P(m, t) $ denote the probability that a site has mass $ m $ at time $ t $. In Mean Field (MF)* approximation, which keeps track of the distribution of masses, ignoring the correlations in the occupancy of adjacent sites, $ P(m, t) $ evolves as follows:

$$
 \frac{dP(m, t)}{dt} = -P(m, t) \sum_{m_1=1}^{\infty} g_m(m_1) - P(m, t) \sum_{m_2=1}^{\infty} P(m, t) \sum_{m_1=1}^{\infty} g_{m_2}(m_1) - q P(m, t) + \sum_{m_1=1}^{\infty} P(m + m_1, t) g_{m + m_1}(m_1) + \sum_{m_2=1}^{\infty} P(m - m_2, t) \sum_{m_1=1}^{\infty} P(m_2, t) g_{m_2}(m_1) + q P(m - k, t) \quad \text{for } m \geq 1
$$



$$
\frac{dP(0, t)}{dt} = -P(0, t) \sum_{m_2=1}^{\infty} P(m_2, t) \sum_{m_1=1}^{\infty} g_{m_2}(m_1) + \sum_{m_1=1}^{\infty} P(m_1, t) g_{m_1}(m_1) - q P(0, t) \quad \text{(2)}
$$

These equations enumerate all possible ways in which a site with mass \( m \) may change its mass. Various terms on the R.H.S of equation (1) can be interpreted as follows:

1st term: loss term due to chipping of a mass \( n \) from a site having mass $( m (\geq n) )$

2nd term: loss term due to coalescence chipped mass after chipping from neighbour

3rd term: Loss term due to adsorption of a unit mass with rate \( q \) at a randomly chosen site, where \( q \) is the adsorption of 'k' units of mass, and $( k = 1, 2, 3, \ldots )$ in various \((k) + 1\) and \((k) + k\).

4th term: Gain term due to fragmentation of excess mass from a site having mass greater than \( m \).

5th term: Gain term due to coalescence to gain the deficit mass at a site having mass less than \( m \).

6th term: Gain term due to adsorption of a unit mass with rate \( q \) at a randomly chosen site having mass less than \( m \).

*MF approximation allows treating each site independently; otherwise, rate equations will contain complicated terms which may make the equation hard to solve.
