Python code for Mass Transport Model mass transport and growth phenomena with kinetic
processes like fragmentation, diffusion, adsorption, aggregation, etc. We use
lattice models: k chip and multiple chip process with adsorption. We solve the
rate equations analytically within MF (Mean Field) approximation wherever
possible; otherwise we implement these models using MC (Monte Carlo)
techniques. The various physical phenomena can be explained using these
models.
