# Mass Transport Phenomenon Modeling
## Introduction
The mass transport phenomenon has been studied widely. This has been great
area of interest for researchers. At microscopic level these phenomena involves
several processes such as fragmentation, adsorption, diffusion and aggregation
which are ubiquitous in nature. These are non-equilibrium in nature, so
it is very hard to determine the steady states from Gibb’s distribution. These
studies proved worth not just artefact of simulation and mathematical work 
Various physical phenomena can be described using these models such as
growing
interfaces,
colloidal
suspensions,
polymer
gels  ,
river
networks granular materials , traffic flows  , etc.

The basic movement of mass here is chipping, where a unit of mass n chips
of from a site having mass $𝑚_i (\geq n)$ where $i=1, 2, 3$ and aggregates to a
randomly chosen adjacent site. The case where only fragmentation and
aggregation is considered is can be described as conserved mass model. In our
project work we consider a more general case of mass transport. Here we
consider not only fragmentation and diffusion but also include adsorption of a
unit of mass at a randomly chosen site. This somewhat complicates our model.

We consider 1-dimensional lattice where mass is randomly distributed at
different lattice sites. For the sake of simplicity, we consider the mass at one site
is not getting affected by mass present at adjacent lattice sites. This allows us to
treat each site individually. Now we consider the movement of mass from one
site to neighbour site under mean field (MF) approximation which keeps track
of the distribution of masses, ignoring the correlations in the occupancy of
adjacent sites. Although MF theory has this shortcoming, our MC simulations
show that this gives an accurate description of the above model in 1
dimensional case.

Our model incorporates two important processes, fragmentation and
adsorption. These processes govern the evolution of system with time. The
dynamic equation which governs transport and steady state behaviour describes
the evolution of $P(m ,t) with time, where P(m ,t) gives the probability of having
a mass m at time t. So the study of mass-transport phenomena boils down to the
study of evolution of P(m ,t) . The rate equations include all the elementary
moves in the system. These rate equations has been solved for different
chipping kernels analytically if possible, otherwise solved numerically using
Monte Carlo methods.

The project focuses on the comprehensive study of mass transport phenomena,. However , mass transport phenoma has been modleled usng diffusion equation . this project takes different approach to model mass transport phenomena.   At the microscopic level, these phenomena involve intricate processes such as fragmentation, adsorption, diffusion, and aggregation, which are widespread in nature . The rate eqaution for such growth model would be like this 
## Rate Equations

Let $P(m, t) $ denote the probability that a site has mass $ m $ at time $ t $. In Mean Field (MF)* approximation, which keeps track of the distribution of masses, ignoring the correlations in the occupancy of adjacent sites, $ P(m, t) $ evolves as follows:

$$
 \frac{dP(m, t)}{dt} = -P(m, t) \sum_{m_1=1}^{\infty} g_m(m_1) - P(m, t) \sum_{m_2=1}^{\infty} P(m, t) \sum_{m_1=1}^{\infty} g_{m_2}(m_1) - q P(m, t) + \sum_{m_1=1}^{\infty} P(m + m_1, t) g_{m + m_1}(m_1) + \sum_{m_2=1}^{\infty} P(m - m_2, t) \sum_{m_1=1}^{\infty} P(m_2, t) g_{m_2}(m_1) + q P(m - k, t) \quad \text{for } m \geq 1
$$



$$
\frac{dP(0, t)}{dt} = -P(0, t) \sum_{m_2=1}^{\infty} P(m_2, t) \sum_{m_1=1}^{\infty} g_{m_2}(m_1) + \sum_{m_1=1}^{\infty} P(m_1, t) g_{m_1}(m_1) - q P(0, t) \quad \text{(2)}
$$

These equations enumerate all possible ways in which a site with mass \( m \) may change its mass. Various terms on the R.H.S of equation (1) can be interpreted as follows:

1st term: loss term due to chipping of a mass \( n \) from a site having mass $( m (\geq n) )$

2nd term: loss term due to coalescence chipped mass after chipping from neighbour

3rd term: Loss term due to adsorption of a unit mass with rate \( q \) at a randomly chosen site, where \( q \) is the adsorption of 'k' units of mass, and $( k = 1, 2, 3, \ldots )$ in various \((k) + 1\) and \((k) + k\).

4th term: Gain term due to fragmentation of excess mass from a site having mass greater than \( m \).

5th term: Gain term due to coalescence to gain the deficit mass at a site having mass less than \( m \).

6th term: Gain term due to adsorption of a unit mass with rate \( q \) at a randomly chosen site having mass less than \( m \).

*MF approximation allows treating each site independently; otherwise, rate equations will contain complicated terms which may make the equation hard to solve.
